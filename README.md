Title: Intoxi-deck

Summary: This is a personal project for a drinking game application. Main purpose for developing this is to hone my skills with React native. If I manage to create a working and fun application I plan to publish it to the play store.
This would be my first published app and I would like to learn what it's like to publish an app.

Features: Turn based drinking game. Inspired by picolo. Users enter players and are given prompts on their turn.

About the app and features: The game is designed to be installed and ran locally on the device, I wont be adding servers or anything like that.
In the future I would like to add minigames to the app. Something like reaction test, 1v1 games etc.

Tech: React native, expo, AsyncStorage
